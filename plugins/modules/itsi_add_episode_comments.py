module: itsi_add_episode_comments
short_description: Add comments to Splunk ITSI episodes
description:
  - Add comments to existing episodes in Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI).
  - Comments are associated with a specific episode and can provide context or status updates.
  - Every invocation creates a new comment; comments cannot be updated or deleted via the API.
version_added: "1.0.0"
author:
  - Ansible Ecosystem Engineering team (@ansible)
options:
  episode_key:
    description:
      - The episode _key to add a comment to.
      - This is the C(_key) field from an episode, as returned by
        M(splunk.itsi.itsi_episode_details_info).
    type: str
    required: true
  comment:
    description:
      - The text content of the comment to add to the episode.
      - Can contain any text describing actions taken, status updates,
        or other relevant information.
    type: str
    required: true
  is_group:
    description:
      - Whether this comment is for an episode group.
      - Should be set to C(true) for ITSI episodes (notable event groups).
    type: bool
    default: true

requirements:
  - Connection configuration requires C(ansible_connection=httpapi) and
    C(ansible_network_os=splunk.itsi.itsi_api_client).
  - Authentication via Bearer token, session key, or username/password
    as documented in the httpapi plugin.
notes:
  - This module adds comments to existing ITSI episodes using the
    notable_event_comment endpoint.
  - The episode must exist before adding comments to it.
  - Comments are permanently associated with the episode and cannot be
    deleted via the API.
  - Use M(splunk.itsi.itsi_episode_details_info) to retrieve episode
    C(_key) values for commenting.
  - This module always returns C(changed=true) because every run creates
    a new comment. Idempotency does not apply.
  - Check mode is supported. In check mode the module reports
    C(changed=true) without actually calling the API.
